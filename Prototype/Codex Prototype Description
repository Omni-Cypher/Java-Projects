Codex rough descriptio: This is a program that helps me automate processes I use as an Oracle Inventory Analyst. From logistics processes to server analysis.
Also it has a Siri like ai conversation bot which does or answers basic conversation and tasks. 
becuase I used this on the job it pings specific servers or load balancers and openned specific programs but those can be remapped to work with wherever your programs are located.
This program is still being developed as of 9/18/19.
